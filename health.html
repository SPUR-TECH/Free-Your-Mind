                        <h2><b>Super foods:</b></h2>
                        <br>
                        <h3><b>Berries.</b>
                            <br>
                            High in fiber, their rich colors mean they are
                            high in antioxidants and disease-fighting nutrients.

                            <br>
                            <b>Fish.</b>
                            <br>
                            Fish can be a good source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent heart
                            disease.

                            <br>
                            <b>Leafy greens.</b>
                            <br>
                            Dark, leafy greens are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium, as
                            well as several phytochemicals (chemicals made by plants that have a positive effect on your
                            health). They also add fiber into the diet.

                            <br>
                            <b>Nuts.</b>
                            <br>
                            Hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, pecans â€” nuts are a good source of plant protein. They
                            also contain monounsaturated fats, which may be a factor in reducing the risk of heart
                            disease.

                            <br>
                            <b>Whole grains.</b>
                            <br>
                            A good source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, whole grains also contain
                            several B vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. They have been shown to lower cholesterol
                            and protect against heart disease and diabetes.

                            <br>
                            <b>Yogurt.</b>
                            <br>
                            A good source of calcium and protein, yogurt also contains live cultures called
                            probiotics. These "good bacteria" can protect the body from other, more harmful bacteria.

                            <br>
                            <b>Cruciferous vegetables.</b>
                            <br>
                            These include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower,
                            collard greens, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, radishes, and turnips. They are an excellent
                            source of fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals including indoles, thiocyanates, and nitriles,
                            which may prevent against some types of cancer.

                            <br>
                            <b>Tomatoes.</b>
                            <br>
                            These are high in vitamin C and lycopene, which has been shown to reduce the risk
                            of prostate cancer.</h3>
