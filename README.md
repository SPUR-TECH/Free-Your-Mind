##  Screen shots of the site and it's responsive abilities:

# Testing:

- First line of testing was to make sure links to each page worked in the NAVBAR, footer and quick links button links to other pages.

- Then tested responsive effects on my phone, Ipad, laptop and pc all worked efficiently.
![](assets/images/image-of-site-on-devices.png)
 ![](assets/images/mixture-of-pages.png)
 ![](assets/images/signing-and-welcoming-pages.png)

- I also tested for accessibility on https://wave.webaim.org/  and lighthouse 
 ![](assets/images/wave-test-results.png)
 ![](assets/images/lighthouse-result.png)


- My testing for my css was performed on https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator
![](assets/images/css-results.png)

- My testing for my html was performed on https://validator.w3.org/ 
![](assets/images/html-results.png)

- I tested Java script on https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html
![](assets/images/js-results.png)

- I then put my site up on Slack for scrutiny and received a lot of compliments.

- spell check README.md on https://www.online-spellcheck.com/

# Bugs and Fixes:

- I had many issues with various areas as the site is so big. the first was the video background aligning and playing and staying behind all other elements so I did top and left 50% then transform translate 50%, 50% and that seemed to work.

- I had issues with image sizing and centering which I dealt with in media queries.

- I had issues with contrast so I adjusted accordingly.

- I had issues with aria labels and adjusted accordingly.

- I had issues with javascript as normal but pressed on and achieved what was necessary.

- I had issues with creating a box to save your favorite items in then thought, This just a demo site and the idea is all thats needed for that to make an account page look like an account page.

- I had issues with click buttons on front page as they had a button with a paragraph in so I turned it into an a tag.

- I had issues with quick scroll to th right place on the page so I created an invisible div, positioned it absolute but a new error was it needed a title so I changed it to a span.
