                <h2>What is Meditation?
                    A brief explanation of the practice.
                    How do you learn to meditate? In mindfulness meditation, we’re learning how to pay attention to the
                    breath as it goes in and out, and notice when the mind wanders from this task. This practice of
                    returning to the breath builds the muscles of attention and mindfulness.

                    When we pay attention to our breath, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the present
                    moment to anchor ourselves in the here and now on purpose, without judgement.

                    The idea behind mindfulness seems simple the practice takes patience.achieve better focus, reduce
                    stress and anxiety and find relaxation and happiness with the ancient
                    practice of meditation.</h2>

                <h2>Why Learn to Meditate?
                    A selection of benefits that are associated with meditating.
                    While meditation isn’t a cure-all, it can certainly provide some much-needed space in your life.
                    Sometimes, that’s all we need to make better choices for ourselves, our families, and our
                    communities. And the most important tools you can bring with you to your meditation practice are a
                    little patience, some kindness for yourself, and a comfortable place to sit.

                    When we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives. And bonus: you
                    don’t need any extra gear or an expensive membership.

                    Here are five reasons to meditate:
                    Understanding your pain
                    Lower your stress
                    Connect better
                    Improve focus
                    Reduce brain chatter</h2>
