                        <h2><b>The (Importance) of exercise!</b></h2>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Exercise can make you feel happier.
                            <br>
                            Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety,
                            and stress.
                            It produces changes in the parts of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also
                            increase brain sensitivity to the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve
                            feelings of depression.
                            Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are known to help
                            produce positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain.
                            Interestingly, it doesn’t matter how intense your workout is. It seems that exercise can
                            benefit your mood no matter the intensity of the physical activity.
                            The effects of exercise on mood are so powerful that choosing to exercise (or not) even
                            makes a difference over short periods of time.

                        <h2><b>Other benefits of exercising:</b></h2>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Exercising can help your brain health and memory:
                            <br>
                            Exercise can improve brain function and protect memory and thinking skills.
                            To begin with, it increases your heart rate, which promotes the flow of blood and oxygen to
                            your brain. It can also stimulate the production of hormones that enhance the growth of
                            brain cells.
                            Regular physical activity is especially important in older adults since aging, combined
                            with oxidative stress and inflammation promotes changes in brain structure and function.

                            Exercise has been shown to cause the hippocampus, a part of the brain that’s vital for
                            memory and learning, to grow in size, which may help improve mental function in older
                            adults.

                            Lastly, exercise has been shown to reduce changes in the brain that can contribute to
                            conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.</h3>
